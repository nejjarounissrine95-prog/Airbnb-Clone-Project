# The Airbnb Clone Project Blueprint
## Project Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security.
### Project Goal
The goal of this project is to build a strong backend that optimizes data and effectively manages users, properties, bookings, reviews, and payments.
The main focus areas are:
1. **User Management:** Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.  
2. **Property Management:** Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.  
3. **Booking System:** Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.  
4. **Payment Processing:** Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.  
5. **Review System:** Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.  
6. **Data Optimization:** Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.  
## Technology Stack
1. **Django:** A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.  
2. **Django REST Framework:** Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.  
3. **PostgreSQL:** A powerful relational database used for data storage.  
4. **GraphQL:** Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.  
5. **Celery:** For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.  
6. **Redis:** Used for caching and session management.  
7. **Docker:** Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.  
8. **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.
## Team Roles
-  **Backend Developer:** Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.  
-  **Database Administrator:** Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.  
-  **DevOps Engineer:** Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.  
-  **QA Engineer:** Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.
## Database Design
### Main Entities:
1. **User**
   - Id
   - Name
   - Email
   - Password
   - Phone_number
   - Created_at
   - Updated_at

2. **Property**
   - Id
   - Owner_Id (linked to User)
   - Title
   - Description
   - Location
   - Price
   - Created_at
   - Updated_at

3. **Booking**
   - Id
   - User_Id (linked to User)
   - Property_Id (linked to Property)
   - Start_date
   - End_date
   - Status (Pending, Confirmed, Cancelled)
   - Created_at
   - Updated_at

4. **Review**
   - Id
   - Booking_Id (linked to Booking)
   - Rating
   - Comment
   - Created_at

5. **Payment**
   - Id
   - Booking_Id (linked to Booking)
   - Amount
   - Status (Paid, Pending, Failed)

### Relationships
-  A **user** can own many **properties**.
-  A **user** can make many **bookings**.
-  A **property** can have many **bookings**.
-  A **booking** belongs to one **property** and one **user**.
-  A **review** belongs to one **booking** (this ensures reviews come from verified stays).
-  A **payment** belongs to one **booking**.
